Source code for https://JaneJeon.github.com - uses pandoc to convert from Markdown to HTML.
The only bits that I'm writing in this repository are index.md, command.sh, css/site.css, js/site.js, and html/*.
index.html is automatically generated by pandoc, which links all the necessary components (except for javascript, so it needs to bootstrap onto one of the html pieces) together to form the final result.
To generate pages, simply run `./command.sh`.
